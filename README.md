# Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision


In recent years, while we are trying to attain the longterm computer vision task of creating smart machines that learn by visual exploration of world. We are currently trying to build on the immediate goal of learning classifiers and recognizing objects in the real world. A common problem that we face is that we require large amount of labeled data for this and at times the tasks we may work on may change. 

The paradigm of domain adaptation has burgeoned for solving this challenge using techniques that try generalizing the knowledge of previous tasks and models in Computer Vision has also been seen. The goal is to understand this application of Domain Adaptation through research publications in leading conferences in the field of Computer Vision.

Some of the tasks we will be going through would be ranging from to computer vision, ranging from image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, face recognition, person re-identification, video understanding and 3D reconstruction.
